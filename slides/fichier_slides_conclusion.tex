\begin{frame}{Conclusion \& prospects: ML project}
\manip Successful $m_{\higgsML}$ reconstruction in di-\tau\ events.
\submanip Not only MSSM \HAtoTauTau\ but any $X\to\tau\tau$ analysis could benefit.
\manip \mml\ vs \mTtot:
\submanip A good mass estimator is not equivalent to a good discriminating variable.
\submanip Still, we already have the same performances at this point.
\manip \mml\ vs \msv:
\submanip Similar Higgs sensitivity for some event topologies.
\submanip Better \Zboson\ estimation observed (the model has been trained on $\higgsML\to\tau\tau$ with various masses only).
\submanip Faster (about 60 times!).
\submanip Could be improved by updating the training datasets (other kinds of events).
\submanip Very promising as a \SVFIT\ successor.
