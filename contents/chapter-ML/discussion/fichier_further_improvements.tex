\section{Discussions}\label{chapter-ML-section-discussion}

\subsection{Mass range}

\subsection{PU effect}
also show PU effect (see fig 2 and 3 from report 2020-11-20, update with new models and samples)

\subsection{Reco effects}
show trained/tested on gen tau, gen tau decays, reco tau decays (=real), see fig 3 from report 2021-01-11

the model understand the physics, now it has to deal with the reco resolution and fakes.

\subsection{Fakes}

\subsection{channel splitting}
not relevant (fig3 report  2021-01-21)

\subsection{Boundaries effects}
use the custom loss with boundaries cuts (basically all the report 2021-02-04)

Follow report from 2021-02-04 but for section 3 : We saw that predictions come out too low, which already is a motivation to put larger weights on higher masses, i.e. to weight by truth. Choosing sqrt(truth) is of course just a guess then

extend up to 1TeV using the tails
