All other backgrounds are taken from simulation.
%For this purpose the simulated events are
%corrected to match the pileup distribution observed in data. Further corrections are derived
%to account for residual differences in the efficiency of the selected trigger paths, for the differ-
%ences in the electron and muon tracking efficiency and in the efficiency of the identification
%and isolation requirements for electrons and muons.
