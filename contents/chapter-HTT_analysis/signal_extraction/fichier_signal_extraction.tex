\section{Extraction du signal}\label{chapter-HTT_analysis-section-signal_extraction}

For the fit we use the implementation of the $CL_S$ method~\cite{CLs_method} provided by \textsc{combine}, the CMS Higgs combination tool based on RooStats \cite{RooStats}.

In the absence of a signal, upper limits on the $\sigma\times\mathcal{B}^{\tau\tau}$ are set using the modified frequentist approach \citep{Junk:1999kv,Read_2002}.

systematic unc. shifts~\cite{BarlowBeeston,BarlowBeeston2}

%For the model-independent interpretation of the results the signal modelling is:
%<br>
%A single Higgs boson resonance phi:
%produced via gluon fusion “ggphi”,
%b-associated production “bbphi”,
%<br>  
%The main model-independent interpretation of the results will contain the SM Higgs boson as background, i.e. the data will be interpreted as a search for a Higgs boson _in addition_ to the observed Higgs boson. 
%<br>
%For the model-dependent interpretation of the results the chosen signal model is:
%<br>
%Light scalar h with mh=125 GeV:
%produced via gluon fusion “ggh”,
%b-associated production “bbh”,
%and vector boson fusion and associated production “(VBF + V(->qq))h = qqh”
%<br>
%Heavy scalar and pseudoscalar A/H:
%produced via gluon fusion “ggA/H”,
%b-associated production “bbA/H”,
%<br>
%Here the observed Higgs boson is interpreted as a SUSY particle (e.g. the h in the $M_h^{125}$ scenario). This interpretation of the data should take into account how compatible the predicted properties of the h are with the observation. This will become one of the most distinguishing signatures of MSSM models in near future. Present and future SUSY models should cope with the findings of our measurements of the observed Higgs boson.
%<br>
%For the qqh contribution, after consultation with theory colleagues, we use the SM prediction scaled by:
%<br>
%sin(beta - alpha)^2 * BR(h--->tautau) / BR(h_SM(125) ---> tautau)
%<br>
%In the decoupling limit, the factor sin(beta - alpha)^2 is essentially one, such that only the branching fraction difference plays a role for this production mode.
%<br>
%You can find some further elaboration to backup this strategy in the following: From
%<br>
%https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/jsp/db_notes/noteInfo.jsp?cmsnoteid=CMS%20AN-2019/177
%<br>
%we expect a constraint of
%<br>
%mu = 1.0 +/- 0.12
%<br>
%for the observed h. This can be translated into the mA -- tanb plane, as done in HIG-19-005.
%
%I would just show the first plot to get the general message across that the MSSM modifies the Higgs XS’s and BRs). For the AN once we have implemented the SM categories in the MSSM analysis we can include clear plots showing how the SM categories change the picture (e.g limits with and without SM categories)
