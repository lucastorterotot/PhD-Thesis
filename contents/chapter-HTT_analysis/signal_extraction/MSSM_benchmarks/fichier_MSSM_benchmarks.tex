%- Fig. 36: Do you intend to give MSSM results also for the negative mu scenarios (hopefully yes)?

%%GREEN%
%Currently we aim to include the following two scenarios into the main paper:
%<br>
%$M_h^{125}$
%<br>
%$M_h^{125}(\tilde{\tau})$
%<br>
%All other scenarios can and will be added as additional material on short circuite with the Higgs PAG conveners. 
%This choice may also be changed in favour of the negative mu scenarios, to be decided later in the review process.
